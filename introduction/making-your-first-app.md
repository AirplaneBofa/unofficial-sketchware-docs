# Adding your app

## Creating the app

**Open Sketchware**

**Click the add + button** at the bottom left of the screen.

**Enter the app name.** This is what will be shown on the launcher \(the text under the app icon when the user installs your app.

**Change the icon** \(optional\)**.** Click the android logo left of the app name.

**Click Advanced Settings**

**Change the app colors** here \(optional\)

**Enter a Package Name.** This is what will be used to uniquely identify your app. It is recommended that you use this format: `domainextention.domain.appname`, for example if this is an app by Sketchub about airplanes, it would be `in.sketchub.airplanes`, since our website is sketchub.in. If you don't have a domain, put `com.yourname.appname`, for example if my name is Bofa, and this is an app about airplanes, I would put `com.bofa.airplanes`. As long as there is no app on the user's device with the same package, you should be fine. 

**Enter a Project Name**. This will show up on Sketchware as the main way to identify this app. If I am creating an app about airplanes, I might put `MyAirplaneApp` as the project name.

**Leave the version code and name the same.** You'll change this later when updating your app

**Click Create App.**

Congratulations, you have created your first app. In the next page, you'll learn about designing and programming your app.
