# Variable

Think of a variable as a bucket. You can put values into it and remove values from it. To reference the variable, you must use its name.

{% hint style="info" %}
Keep in mind that variable values aren't saved, so when the app is closed, they get reset. You can use the [SharedPreference](https://wiki.sketchub.in/components/sharedpreference) block with a `ToStringWithoutDecimal` block to save their values.
{% endhint %}
