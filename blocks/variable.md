# Variable

## What is a variable?
Think of a variable as a bucket. You can put values into it and remove values from it. To reference the variable, you must use its name.

Keep in mind that variable values aren't saved, so when the app is closed, they get reset. You can use the [SharedPreference](https://wiki.sketchub.in/components/sharedpreference) block with a `ToStringWithoutDecimal` block to save their values.
