# Concept

Widgets and Layouts help to design your app. You can add available widgets just by dragging and dropping from the list as shown:

> Fact: When the project is compiled, all the views are translated into **XML**. To view translated XML, go to Open your Project &gt; Menu &gt; Show Source Code

## Layout

#### Linear Layout

By default, widgets are placed vertically on the screen. You can place widgets horizontally inside the Linear\(H\) layout and vertically inside the Linear\(V\) layout.

{% hint style="info" %}
In "Pic.1", Linear \(V\) is used.
{% endhint %}

#### Scroll View

As the name suggests, contents in the scroll view are scrollable as shown:

![Scrolling contents \(Pic. 3\)](../.gitbook/assets/scrolling_example.gif)

{% hint style="success" %}
A scroll view is a must-have for almost all apps.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you are adding multiple contents in scroll view, it is necessary to add a linear layout and then your contents inside of it.
{% endhint %}
